One upon the time, a big and strong man who have been living in a zoo terrarium on an alien planet since he was young.
How he came to know that he was living in a terrarium with the strings of his fate pulled for a class project.

He always think to make some changes on his life. He keeps thinking he lives in two worlds.
Then a cosmic meteor hit his zoo and then shook his home

His place, the zoo terrarium, it is not a normal zoo because it is on an alien planet! 
In his place, he does not have to worry work, housing, cleaning, and food. 
He wants to decide between an easy life in the zoo or unknown future somewhere else. 
He says to himself that he is not an animal because he looks like human even his face looks like half human and alien.
Now he is waiting for someone take him out from this small environment. He wants to explore the real planet.
Living alone in his terrarium for 200 years he became very lonley, but this all came to an end when he saw what appeared to be an orange man walking towards him one day. "What is your name he asked the orange man". "My name is Donald Trump and I was kicked out of my planet for being an idiot", "No problem, I will make this my new home". He looked at the orange man called Trump and thought, what an unusual pet he had on his head and was afraid, so he smashed the orange man and Donald blew up into a million little pieces.
