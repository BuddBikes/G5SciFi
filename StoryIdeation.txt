One upon the time, a big and strong man who have been living in a zoo terrarium on an alien planet since he was young.
How he came to know that he was living in a terrarium with the strings of his fate pulled for a class project.

He always think to make some changes on his life. He keeps thinking he lives in two worlds.
Then a cosmic meteor hit his zoo and then shook his home

His place, the zoo terrarium, it is not a normal zoo because it is on an alien planet! 
In his place, he does not have to worry work, housing, cleaning, and food. 
He wants to decide between an easy life in the zoo or unknown future somewhere else. 
He says to himself that he is not an animal because he looks like human even his face looks like half human and alien.
Now he is waiting for someone take him out from this small environment. He wants to explore the real planet.

Suddenly, he run to a big river of planet, and he can see himself reflects to surface of water. He says "I am a big green man", and asks himself "am I an alien?". I want to discover Earth. He knows that he is one type of creatures, and he may not understand humans, and their instinct. "I am peaceful even I have to be alien refugee on  earth".
He is looking for a spaceship that used to take him and his friends to the moon for vacation many years ago. The spaceship is fast. he used to see the pilot used the laser and beam whilst the gunner fired the missile turrets. 

He is thinking, "how I can find someone can help me the explore the earth". 
He is keeping talking to himself, "right... that pilot who took me to the moon!, I need to see him".
He know where he is. If that pilot can't go with him; at least the pilot can give him some ideas.
He have watched the way to fly spaceship many, many times, and he thinks a lot about what makes him a good pilot.
